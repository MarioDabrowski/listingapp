# Listing App 0.1.0

Write a description here.

## Installation

1. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) if you don't have it yet.
2. Pull down my repo by clicking the 'Download Zip' button on the right or [clicking here](https://github.com/MarioDabrowski/listingapp/archive/master.zip).
3. In the folder you downloaded run `npm install` and `bower install`
4. To launch the php server run `grunt php`
5. In a new Temrinal tab run `grunt watch` (This is only temporary, see Bugs & Issues)

## Current Functionality

- Ability to add and remove categories
- Ability to add sub categories

## Todo

- Add functionality to remove sub categories
- Refactor javascript
- Skin UI
- Intergrate handlebars

## Bugs & Issues

- Grunt-php throws [200] errors when the server is running. I have contacted the creator about this issue.
- The built in grunt live reload isn't working for php pages. To solve this install the [live reload browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).
